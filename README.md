# sat2csv
A C++ tool for extracting data from SAT solvers or bounded model checkers output into csv format. It supports various solvers including ParaFROST or MiniSat and the bounded model checker CBMC. Information like the running time or the Satisfiability result will be parsed into a comma-separated file.

# Input
As input, it reads a log file generated by the solver if the file had the prefix "result_" and the extension ".txt". 

# Output 
A table in comma-separated CSV format.

# Example
Run the tool on the test folder (contains logs from parafrost and minisat solvers) using the commad: 
   sat2csv test -s test_results
   
where "test" is the directory name containing the log files, "-s" instructs the tool to extract a SAT solver information, and "test_results" is the name of the CSV file.
The output file produced will look like this:

CNF,______________________________Simplify time (s),__Solve time (s),____Sat.<br/>
01-integer-programming-20-30-40,__4.242,______________3201.933,__________S<br/>
9dlx_vliw_at_b_iq1,_______________0,__________________19.5243,___________U<br/>
Total time :,_____3225.6993<br/>		

The "S" and "U" letters denotes "SATISFIABLE" and "UNSATISFIABLE" respectively.

# Install
Just run "sat2csv/compile.sh" on a Linux-based machine or compile the sources on Windows with any C/C++ compiler to produce the binary <sat2csv>. For more help on the available options use "-h".
